# BlamScript-Research

This is a repository for information relating to the **Blam! Scripting Language**, the language that is used to script levels in all of the Halo games. For now, it will focus just on Halo 2 Classic/Vista information. 

My goal is to have definitively researched information on the various scripting related easter-eggs, encounters and glitches (all with relevant map data), in hopes of fully documenting and understanding them, and then using that information to assist in finding new glitches.
