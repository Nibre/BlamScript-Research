# BlamScript-Research

This is a repository for information relating to the Blam! Scripting Language, the language that is used to script levels in all of the Halo games. For now, it will focus just on Halo 2 Classic/Vista information. 

My goal is to have definitively researched information on the various scripting related easter-eggs, encounters and glitches (all with relevant map data), in hopes of fully documenting and understanding them, and then using that information to assist in finding new glitches.
